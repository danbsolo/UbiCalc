# AlgebraicOperations Features

Instructions for using these files in specific would go here.
A table of contents would be a good idea as well, if markdown enables it.

So far, I'm not documenting well, but I'll get around to it.


## What's New:
- Fixed a lot of bugs.
- Added rooting, such as squared or cubed rooting, or whatever you want
- Added square bracket functionality for ease of use
- Added shorthand for hard fractions
- Added absolute value notation
- Changed the name of the file for certain reasons. Tbh, it should be changed once more to fit the PEP8 style guidelines
- Speaking of the PEP8 style guide, I edited the file to assume that format
- Added docstrings
- Added other things I might be forgetting :) I really should document more :thinking:
